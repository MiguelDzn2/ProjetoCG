# Coding Standards

This rule outlines the coding standards to be followed when developing the Computer Graphics project.

## Python Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length of 80 characters
- Use docstrings for all classes and functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Project-Specific Patterns

- Instrument-specific geometry classes should inherit from their base geometry type
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - Class names: CamelCase
  - Functions and variables: snake_case
  - Constants: UPPER_CASE

## Scene Management

- All 3D objects should be added to the scene graph
- Use MovementRig for objects that need to be controlled
- Apply transformations in the order: scale, rotation, translation

## Input Handling

- All user input should be processed in the appropriate phase-specific handler
- Movement and rotation rates should be scaled by delta_time for frame-rate independence
- Use descriptive variable names for movement/rotation amounts

## Code Organization

- Keep the phase logic separate and modular
- Maintain clear separation between initialization and update logic
- Group related functions together within classes
